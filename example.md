wait... what was that?

This file triggers 2 warnings. The top heading is bad, as it is followed by an `hr` or thematicBreak, while the third header is followed by an hr, with nothing but whitespace beforehand.

The second para is fine, as there is content between the header and the thematicBreak. Dont use rules to underline headings. Dont try and thematically break content when there is no content.

## this is ok

as there is a paragraph

...between the heading and the content

### this is no ok
